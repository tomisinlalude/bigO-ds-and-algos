# Big O, Data Structures, Algorithms

## Linear Time Complexity
Linear Time Complexity describes an algorithm or program whose complexity will **grow in direct proportion** to the size of the input data. Its Big O notation is denoted by O(n)

## Constant Time Complexity
Constant Time Complexity describes an algorithm that will always **execute in the same time** regardless of the size of the input data set. Its Big O notation is denoted by O(1)
