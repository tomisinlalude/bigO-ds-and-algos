Step by step through a problem:
1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the
2. Make sure you double check: What are the inputs?
3. What is the most important value of the problem?
4. Don't be annoying and ask too many questions
5. Start with the naive/brute force approach
6. Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e)
7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see
8. Before you start coding, walk through your code
9. Modularize your code from the very beginning.
10. Start actually writing your code now. Keep in mind
11. Think abour error checks and how you can break this
12.Don't use bad conflicting names like i and j
13. Test your code: Check for no params, 0, undefined,

Good code checklist
- It works
- Good use of data structures
- Code re-use/Do not repeat yourself
- Modular, Makes code more readable, maintainable
- Less than O(n^2), we want to avoid nested loops
- Low space complexity, recursion can cause stack

Interview question

Given two arrays, create a function that let's a user know whether these two arrays contain any common
items. For example,
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
const array2 = ['x', 'y', 'z']
should return false 
while
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x']
const array2 = ['x', 'y', 'z']
should return true
